# resume-filtering(Ongoing)

Technical Description: For this project I have used Python for writing the script and as a backend I have used NoSql(neo4j) Database to store data.

In this project I am going to automate the filtering process of resume to enhance the recruitment. My objective is to select an appropriate resume for a job.The resume is selected on the basis of Qualification and Skills.

Python libraries used

1.numpy

2.re(Regular Expression)

3.nltk

4.tqdm

5.py2neo

Usage: Import all the above mentioned library in Python.then extract the keyword phrases and store it in NoSql database(neo4j).With the help of GUI we will show the selected resume. We will finally run the neoDatabse.py script to covert pdf resume to plain text and extract keyword phrases and store it in Neo4j database.
